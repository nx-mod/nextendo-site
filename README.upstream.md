## What's here

- **Create an account**: a Nextendo identity with a permanent friend code, usable on the emulator and on a real Switch.
- **Friends & presence**: add friends by code, see who's online.
- **Your profile**: nickname, avatar, and your game history.
- **Account & security**: email verification, password reset, and active-session management.
- **Game pages**: eShop details, screenshots, your play time, and a link to buy the game on the Nintendo eShop of your country.
- **Network status & progress**: live player counts and how far online play has come, game by game.
- **Nextendo Developers**: the portal to register an application that signs players in with their Nextendo account.
- **10 languages**: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic.

## Translations

The pages are written in English. `assets/js/i18n.js` translates the English text itself, using one dictionary per language in `assets/js/i18n/`.

Those dictionaries are generated: edit the sources in `outils/i18n/` (`a_traduire.txt` holds one English string per line, `t_<lang>.txt` holds `<line number><TAB><translation>`), then run:

```
node outils/i18n/construire.js
```

Editing a file in `assets/js/i18n/` directly works until the next build, which rewrites it.

## Stack

- Static front-end (HTML/CSS/JS), served by nginx.
- A small Go account API (accounts, friends, presence, profile sync) behind a reverse proxy.
- Self-hosted transactional email (verification / password reset).

> The front-end lives here. The online **game servers** and account back-end run privately.
